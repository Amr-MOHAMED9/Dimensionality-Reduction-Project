# Dating web-app profiles analysis with scope on Dimensionality reduction and Clustering techniques

In this project, a dataset of an mythical dating application was used to perform the different techniques of Dimensionality Reduction or to transform data from a high-dimensional space into a low dimensional space so that the low-dimensional representation retains some meaningful properties of the original data, ideally close to its intrinsic dimension. In addition, we will be working with K-means and Hierarchical Clustering techniques to divide datasets into different clusters.
